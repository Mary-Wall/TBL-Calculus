An airplane is flying at an altitude of 3 miles and passes directly over a radar antenna. When the plane is 10 miles from the antenna (measured along the ground), the radar detects that the distance from the antenna to the plane is changing at a rate of 350 miles per hour. If you were to drop a point on the ground straight down from the plane, how fast is that point moving away from the antenna? (Note that this can count for objectives 16 and 17. Be very clear with your setup.)
