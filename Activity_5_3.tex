\chead{Math 121 - Riemann Sums}

\begin{document}
Suppose we have a function $f(x)$, and we would like to know the exact area under the curve, over the interval $[a,b]$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \textit{Riemann Sum}, as defined in the book, is
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i) \Delta x.$$
\item If there are $n$ subdivisions of $[a,b]$, how long must each of these be? Write this as $\Delta x = ?$.
\item Assume we start at $a$, and move to the right, moving $\Delta x$ each time. We write $x_0 = a$, $x_1 = a + \Delta x$, and so forth. What would we write for $x_i$? How about $x_n$?
\item Replace $f_i$ and $\Delta x$ in the formula in (1) by what you found in (2) and (3).
\item For each of the functions below, write the Riemann Sum over the given interval.
\begin{itemize}
\item $f(x) = x^2$ over $[0,1]$
\item $g(x) = x^3$ over $[-1,0]$
\item $h(x) = \sin(x)$ over $[-\pi,\pi]$
\item $k(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ over $[1,2]$
\end{itemize}
\item This is the Riemann Sum for a function. What is the function, and over what interval are we trying to find the area?
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(2 + \frac{5i}{n}\right) \frac{3}{n}.$$
\item Suppose you wanted to exactly find the area under the curve $f(x) = x^2$ over $[0,1]$, using a Riemann Sum. We will do this together as a class.
\end{enumerate}
