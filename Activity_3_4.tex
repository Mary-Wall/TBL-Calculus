\item A rock is dropped straight off a bridge that is 50 meters above the ground and falls at a speed of 10 $m$/sec.  Another person is 7 meters away on the same bridge.  At what rate is the distance between the rock and the second person increasing just as the rock hits the ground?
\item A 15 foot ladder is leaning up against a wall. The bottom of the ladder is sliding away form the wall at 1 foot per second. How fast is the top of the ladder moving down the wall when the bottom is 5 feet away from the wall?
\item A 6 foot tall man is walking away from a 18 foot tall lightpost. The light comes over the mans head, and casts a shadow on the ground. If the man is walking at 3 feet per second, how fast is the tip of his shadow moving away from the lightpost?
